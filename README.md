# Cats_Vs_Dogs

A simple Convolutional Neural Network model for Binary Classification problem of Cats Vs Dogs.

Used techniques like Data/Image Augmentation to augment data like zooming in, moving the object around the image, rotating the image through an angle.

Then used Transfer Learning of the inception v3 model to load in the pre-trained weights of the model.

Achieved a
